# Build Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies
Added to `package.json`:
- `@nestjs/schedule: ^4.0.0` - For cron jobs
- `@nestjs/mapped-types: ^2.0.4` - For DTO partial types
- `tweetnacl: ^1.0.3` - For Solana signature verification

### 2. TypeScript Import Errors
- Added `Body` import to `user.controller.ts`
- Added `InjectDataSource` import to `orders.service.ts` from `@nestjs/typeorm`

### 3. Type Conversion Issues
- Fixed `totalSupply` conversion: Convert number to BigInt in `assets.service.ts`
- Fixed `contractAddress` assignment: Extract from `DeployResult` object
- Fixed transaction filters: Convert string dates to Date objects in controller

### 4. Type Assertion Issues
- Fixed OASIS auth response extraction with proper type casting
- Fixed Buffer to Blob conversion in smart-contract.service.ts

### 5. Duplicate Export
- Fixed duplicate `BlockchainType` enum export in wallet dto index.ts

## Next Steps

After these fixes are committed and pushed:

1. Railway should automatically redeploy
2. If it doesn't, trigger a manual redeploy
3. Monitor the build logs for any remaining errors

## Testing Locally

Before pushing, test the build locally:
```bash
cd pangea/backend
npm install
npm run build
```

If the build succeeds locally, it should work on Railway.
