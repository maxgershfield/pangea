# Task 05: Smart Contract Generator - Status Update

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** 🔄 Partial (80% Complete)

---

## ✅ What's Complete

1. **SmartContractService** - Full implementation with:
   - ✅ RWA Token contract generation
   - ✅ Order Book contract generation
   - ✅ Trade Execution contract generation
   - ✅ Vault contract generation
   - ✅ Complete generate → compile → deploy flow (code implemented)
   - ✅ Error handling and retry logic (3 retries with exponential backoff)
   - ✅ Support for both form-data package and global FormData (Node.js 18+)

2. **SmartContractsController** - REST API endpoints:
   - ✅ `POST /smart-contracts/deploy-rwa-token` - Deploy RWA token
   - ✅ `POST /smart-contracts/deploy-order-book` - Deploy order book
   - ✅ `POST /smart-contracts/deploy-trade-execution` - Deploy trade execution
   - ✅ `POST /smart-contracts/deploy-vault` - Deploy vault
   - ✅ `GET /smart-contracts/cache-stats` - Get compilation cache stats

3. **DTOs** - Request validation:
   - ✅ `DeployRwaTokenDto` - Validates RWA token deployment requests

4. **Module Integration** - SmartContractsModule added to AppModule

## ⚠️ What's Pending

### Contract Deployment

The integration code is complete and ready, but **the actual contracts have not been deployed to the Solana blockchain yet**.

**Required Actions:**
1. Deploy RWA Token contract
2. Deploy Order Book contract
3. Deploy Trade Execution contract
4. Deploy Vault contract
5. Store contract addresses in database
6. Update asset records with contract addresses

---

## 🚀 How to Complete Task 05

### Step 1: Configure Environment

Add to `.env`:
```env
# SmartContractGenerator API
SMART_CONTRACT_GENERATOR_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Solana Wallet (for deployment)
SOLANA_WALLET_KEYPAIR_PATH=/path/to/your/wallet-keypair.json

# Platform Wallet (for fee collection)
PLATFORM_WALLET=YOUR_PLATFORM_WALLET_ADDRESS

# Issuer Wallet (for RWA tokens)
ISSUER_WALLET=YOUR_ISSUER_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

### Step 2: Deploy Contracts

**Via API (Recommended):**
```bash
# 1. Get JWT token
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"YOUR_EMAIL","password":"YOUR_PASSWORD"}' \
  | jq -r '.access_token')

# 2. Deploy RWA Token
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/smart-contracts/deploy-rwa-token" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Pangea RWA Token",
    "symbol": "PRWA",
    "totalSupply": 1000000,
    "metadataUri": "https://pangea.rkund.com/metadata/rwa-token.json",
    "issuerWallet": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS",
    "decimals": 0
  }'

# 3. Deploy Order Book
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/smart-contracts/deploy-order-book" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 4. Deploy Trade Execution
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/smart-contracts/deploy-trade-execution" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 5. Deploy Vault
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/smart-contracts/deploy-vault" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Via Script:**
```bash
cd /Volumes/Storage/OASIS_CLEAN/pangea/backend
npx ts-node scripts/deploy-contracts.ts
```

### Step 3: Store Contract Addresses

After deployment, contract addresses will be returned in the API response. These need to be:
1. Stored in the database (create a contracts table or add to existing tables)
2. Associated with assets (update `tokenized_assets` table)
3. Used in subsequent operations

---

## ⏱️ Estimated Time to Complete

- **Deployment:** 1-2 hours (depending on compilation time - first build can take 20+ minutes)
- **Database updates:** 30 minutes
- **Testing:** 1 hour
- **Total:** 2.5-3.5 hours

---

## 📊 Current Status

**Progress:** 80% Complete

**Completed:**
- ✅ Integration code
- ✅ API endpoints
- ✅ Service implementation
- ✅ Error handling

**Pending:**
- ⚠️ Actual contract deployment
- ⚠️ Contract address storage
- ⚠️ Integration with asset records

---

## 🎯 Completion Criteria

Task 05 will be considered **complete** when:
1. ✅ All 4 contracts are deployed to Solana (devnet or mainnet)
2. ✅ Contract addresses are stored in the database
3. ✅ Contract addresses are associated with assets
4. ✅ Deployment can be verified via blockchain explorer
5. ✅ Contracts are functional and can be interacted with
